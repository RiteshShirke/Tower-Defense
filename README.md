Tower Defense Game
Overview
This is a simple Tower Defense game built using C++ with a strong focus on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The game challenges the player to strategically place towers to defend against waves of enemies. It demonstrates the use of several fundamental algorithms and data structures such as A pathfinding*, priority queues, binary search trees, linked lists, and dynamic programming.

Features
Pathfinding Algorithm (A)**: Enemies navigate through the map using the A algorithm, finding the shortest path to reach the player's base.
Priority Queue (Min-Heap): Manages the spawning order and priority of enemies, ensuring that enemies attack in the correct order.
Graph Data Structure: The game map is represented as a graph where nodes are possible positions for enemies and towers.
Binary Search Trees: Used for storing and managing tower upgrade paths and high scores for efficient searching and updating.
Dynamic Programming: Optimizes tower placement and damage calculations.
Linked Lists: Efficiently manage the list of active enemies and towers.
Gameplay
Towers: Players can place various types of towers (e.g., basic, sniper) on the grid to attack enemies. Towers can be upgraded to enhance their damage and range.
Enemies: Enemies spawn in waves, with each wave progressively more difficult. They will follow the shortest path calculated by the A* algorithm to reach the player's base.
Map: The game map is a grid where the player can place towers and where enemies move. Obstacles can be added to force enemies to take longer paths.

Installation
To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC )
VS Code or another IDE for C++ development
Cloning the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tower-defense-game.git
cd tower-defense-game
Building the Game
Compile the game using a C++ compiler. If you're using GCC, run the following command in the terminal:

code
g++ -std=c++17 -o game src/main.cpp
If you're using Visual Studio, compile with the appropriate build settings.

Run the compiled executable:

code
./game
Running the Game
Once compiled, run the game executable from your terminal or IDE.
The game will start, and you can place towers on the map and defend against waves of enemies.

How It Works
Pathfinding (A* Algorithm)
The A* algorithm is used to find the shortest path for enemies from their spawn point to the player's base. It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to explore nodes based on their cost (f = g + h), where g is the cost from the start node and h is the heuristic estimate to the goal node.

Towers and Enemies
Towers: Each tower has attributes like range and damage. When enemies enter their range, towers will attack them. Towers can be upgraded through a binary search tree structure, which allows for efficient searching and updating of tower stats.
Enemies: Enemies spawn at the start of each wave and follow the A* path to reach the base. Each enemy has health and speed attributes, and they are managed in a priority queue to determine the order of their actions.
Map Representation
The map is a grid where towers can be placed on certain tiles, and enemies move along other tiles. Obstacles can be placed to force enemies to take longer paths to the base.

Future Improvements
Graphical Interface: Add a graphical interface using a library like SFML or SDL to visually represent the game on the screen.
More Tower Types: Introduce new tower types with unique abilities, such as freezing enemies or area-of-effect damage.
Additional Enemy Types: Add different enemy types with special abilities, such as flying enemies that bypass obstacles or armored enemies with higher health.
Save and Load Feature: Implement the ability to save the game state and load it later.
